This is my personal website.

## About

As a Software Engineer, I felt the need of having a personal website that works as a portfolio to showcase my projects, skills and history.

The first version of my website was built with Wordpress and a bunch of plugins. I wasn't comfortable with that and decided to code my own version. Now I have control to make it the way I want without relying on proprietary tools.

## Technologies

This website was built using `Next.js` with `Typescript`. Styled with `Sass`.
## Approach

The website currently has only one page and it's static. The page is generated at build time as its content never changes.
